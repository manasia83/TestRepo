1) Artifactory → NAS (preferred)
Package & publish release artifact to Artifactory (versioned, with checksum/SBOM).

Approve CR for “stage to NAS”.

From a controlled host, stage the approved artifact from Artifactory to the NAS release path.

Verify integrity (checksum) and mark the version as “current” on NAS.

Raise/attach deployment CR referencing the exact NAS “current” path and artifact details.

Run the standard NAS → Linux deploy script to promote to servers.

Post-deploy validation (health checks), log capture, CR closure.

2) CR-driven: Prod Support pulls from Git → NAS
Create/approve CR for “pull tagged release and stage to NAS”.

Prod support stages the approved, tagged release artifact to the NAS release path.

Verify integrity and mark the version as “current” on NAS.

Attach artifact/tag details to the CR for traceability.

Run the standard NAS → Linux deploy script to promote to servers.

Post-deploy validation (health checks), log capture, CR closure.

Common: NAS → Linux (deployment script path)
Pre-checks (NAS reachable, “current” exists, maintenance window open).

Create per-app isolated runtime (venv/container) and app directories.

Expand artifact, install dependencies, apply non-secret config.

Restart app/service and run health checks.
